## PSEUDO CODE ⚒
    ❎  Create a node project
    ❎  Set node version in a .nvmrc file
    ❎  Ignore node_modules in a .gitignore file
    ❎  Create an index file in the root folder
    ❎  Install the following dependencies:
  
       💠 Express
       💠 Body parser
       💠 Mongoose
       💠 Winston
